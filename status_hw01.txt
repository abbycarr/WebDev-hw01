5. Which parts of this assignment did you have trouble with, if any?
I got a 'connection timed out' error when doing ssh root@domain. I spent hours trying
any/all options I could find online and ended up completely reinstalling the operating
system and getting a new ssh key only to still have to start a completely new VPS
before getting ssh root@domain to work. Don't know why this was so awful? No one 
seemed to understand why, it just sucked is all.
